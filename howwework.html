		<h1>how we work</h1> <br> <br> <br>

			<p>
				When we first get a project from a client, we all get together on a skype and brainstorm ideas. We discuss how much time we are going to need, the tools that are going to be involved, how much money will be spent. Even though we all play our special roles, we all don't suggesting design ideas.  We make sure we reach an agreement on the design, tools, time frame and the specifications for the project.
			</p><br>
			
			<p>
			After the initial phase. Our lead designer starts wire-framing whiles front end and back end starts design and discussing how both worlds are going to collide. Both the front end and back end team work developers work on front end if there's no need for a back end in a project. We normally spend a week or two at the most on this part of the process.</p><br>
			
			<p>After the design team is done with the wire-frames, flow charts, psds etc, we start working  on the project right away. Time of completion is  dependent on the size or type of project. For small projects like personal websites, portfolios, landing pages or simple redesigns we spend between 3 to 2 months.  For bigger projects like blogs, e-commerce sites, forums, business websites or anything of the scale we take about 2 to 6 months to complete.  We also acts as design and products consultants for your web design team.</p><br>
			
			<p>
				Our pricing is very feasible and affordable.  We also help our clients through the acquisition of a domain name. We also aid in the hosting process .
